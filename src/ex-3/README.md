## Exercise 1

Implement a GameOfLife class/constructor function/factory function (whatever the preference) so that:

- it can keep track of the state of the game
- it allows the state of any cell to be toggled (if it was alive it should die, if it was dead it should become alive)
- it can compute and put game in the next state

## Exercise 2

For brownie points, try and make it with large sparsely populated boards.
