## Exercise 1

Test-drive the observable mixin. You should be able to add and remove listeners of different types, specify their priority (order of invocation) and handle mis-behaving listeners. There should be a way of stopping the event propagation.

For brownie points, add the support for observable properties.

## Exercise 2

Add another button ("Decrement") to counter widget (and modify the counter model accordingly) so that it can count downwards.

## Exercise 3
