## Exercise 1

Test-drive [random.org](https://api.random.org/json-rpc/2/basic) integration. The goal is to be able to request 'real' floating-point random numbers (check generateDecimalFractions method). For making http requests, use [node-fetch](https://github.com/bitinn/node-fetch) module (very similar to browser's window.fetch).
